# 4-Mecanum-wheeled-Manipulator-with-6-DOF-for-Warehouses

**Project Overview**:
This project features the mechanical design and simulation of a 6 DOF robotic manipulatorto handle tasks such as object picking, placing, and stacking. The integration with a Mecanum-wheeled base allows for smooth omnidirectional movement in constrained warehouse environments. While this repository focuses on the mechanical design and simulations, it reflects key contributions to the project.

**Included Files**

**Mechanical Design (STEP files):**
3D models of the robotic manipulator, detailing its joints and arm structure.

**Simulation Files (Simscape):**
Simscape Multibody files for analyzing the manipulatorâ€™s kinematics and dynamic behavior.
