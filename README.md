# 4-Mecanum-wheeled-Manipulator-with-6-DOF-for-Warehouses

**Project Overview**
This project features the mechanical design and simulation of a 6 DOF robotic manipulator integrated with a 4 Mecanum-wheeled base, developed for warehouse automation tasks. The manipulator is designed to perform precise object handling while being adaptable to omnidirectional movement offered by Mecanum wheels.

**Included Files**

**Mechanical Design (STEP files):**
3D models of the robotic manipulator, detailing its joints and arm structure.

**Simulation Files (Simscape):**
Simscape Multibody files for analyzing the manipulatorâ€™s kinematics and dynamic behavior.
